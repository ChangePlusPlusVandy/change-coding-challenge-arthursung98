1. Running the Code
	I completed this project using only Java, so the code should be good to run
	without special settings required. I did add an external JAR to deal with the
	JSON data, and hopefully that is also included with the git push.

2. Bumps along the way
	The first obstacle I faced was that the endpoint only returned 200 tweets to me,
	and excluding the ones that were retweets or had media content, the number of
	tweets returned to me was small. I tried to fix this by playing around with the 
	parameters on the endpoint, but couldn't figure it out. I wish I could've
	solved this issue so the players could enjoy many more genius tweets from Ye,
	but I might need additional resources to make that happen.

3. Room for Improvement
	So the program runs and serves its intended purpose, but I have a lot of things
	that I wish I could have implemented. I tried to use a React Framework, but because
	I had no experience in it, and our professors love packing everything in one week, it seemed 
	infeasible to learn the whole thing this week. I'm also a huge supporter of aesthetic presentation, 
	and so I tried making this a dynamic web project with HTML so the user could press buttons for 
	submitting their responses. In all, there were a lot of things I wish I could've done, but was unable to get to.
	Nevertheless I really enjoyed this challenge, and I think given more time these are definitely technologies
	that I can improve on. I hope that I can continue picking up new skills along the way with Change++.

Thanks!
